Howdy cowpokes!

Thanks to all of you who came out for the talk. If you'd like to see it again you can [watch it here](http://youtube.com/watch?v=_20LcYvUFVQ) and [review the slides here](http://talks.themeteorchef.com/meteor-superpowers-for-javascript-developers).

You can also find a supplemental tutorial that walks you through building a Meteor application [here](http://themeteorchef.com/recipes/mwjs).

If you have any questions, I'm always available on Twitter [@themeteorchef](http://twitter.com/themeteorchef) or
