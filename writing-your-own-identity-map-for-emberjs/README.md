# Writing your own identity map for ember.js

by [Toran Billups](https://twitter.com/toranb)

## Summary

Is your team starting to outgrow the simple $.ajax approach to data access? Are projects like ember-data appealing but you'd prefer to gain a better understanding of the magic before you bolt on another megabyte of javascript? Join me for an intense live coding session as I build an identity map test-first using ember-cli!
In addition to the javascript content, I'll also cover some traditional test driven development concepts in the process. 

1) The basics: write a test first that includes the assertion to prove a given behavior.
2) It's all about feedback: you don't need to make the test pass immediately, instead if the error message changes between test runs you are still using tdd correctly.
3) Avoid implementation as much as you can: if you have confidence in your test code (and the test code is implementation agnostic) you can easily refactor your production code as you add new features.
