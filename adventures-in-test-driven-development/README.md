## Summary

You know how important it is to test your code, and may have heard about the benefits of test-driven development. 
The challenge is figuring out what test-driven development looks like, and how to implement it in your development workflow. 
I will demonstrate test-driven development through building a feature (live coding!), and I'll show you how easy it is to implement testing in your own projects!
